# Welcome to [Debio-Sql](https://debio-sql.sourceforge.io) download page

We tried to provide a **simple, lite and portable** with atleast *dependency* **Mnagement tool**,
For us that tried and experience some OS (most of Linux), We faced to package deficiency
in some of them that force us to download and make package personally, off course this
introduce and learn us a world of knowledge about develop mechanism! Also it is a boring way
to who need just install and use in some distros.
We did it in a **cross platform** way, You have it in most used *platforms* with the same **UI** and functionality.

***Necessity is the mother of all invention***
